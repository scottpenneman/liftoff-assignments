# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
During the Covid-19 Pandemic, which kept many of us under stay-at-home orders, my friends and I revisited something we used to do frequently - play multiplayer games online. I am the common denominator between a group of friends in Kansas and a group of friends in Texas. We all have a different collection of devices to play games on, including computers, Nintendo Switches, Playstation 4s, and Xbox Ones. We also have wildly different game libraries.

A frequent wish that we all have is crossplay compatibility for games that we play. Usually, a player on a PS4 would not be able to play with someone on an Xbox One, or any other match of different consoles out there. Since we don't all have the same devices to play games on, we have to make sure they are crossplay compatible before purchasing. After doing some research, there were a lot out there that we didn't know about!

The app will have a user input the devices they have for playing games, add games that they have to their library (only games that support some level of crossplay functionality), and then be able to compare what games they have in common with other users to easily find a game to play.

### Features
* **User Login:** Users will be able to create accounts and passwords and log in to the application. They will also create a profile with optional information such as Xbox Live Gamertags, Playstation Network IDs, and Steam profile names.
* **Device and Game Selection:** Users will select which devices they have from a pre-determined list and add them to their device library. Users will then select which games they have from a pre-determined list and add them to their game library. 
(The devices and games that will be used can be found on the [Wikipedia entry for crossplay compatible games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_that_support_cross-platform_play).
* **Game Selection Search:** Users will be able to search for a game title, and be able to select it to add to their library.
* **Game Library Comparison:** Users will be able to compare what games they have in common with other users. The other usernames will be visible.
* **Other User Profile View:** When a user has games in common with other users, they will be able to click on the other username to view their profile card. The other users profile card will show their profile information, device library, and game library.
